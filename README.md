# Anbox Cloud - Tutorials

This repository provides a set of tutorials on how to implement different uses cases with
the features Anbox Cloud offers to run Android devices at scale in the cloud.

While the dashboard offers easy access to basic features, most of the strengths of Anbox Cloud
appear when you start customizing it to your needs. Every component of Anbox Cloud has a public API
and SDKs are also available to get you started quickly.

These code samples require an Anbox Cloud deployment, if you do not have one, you can
go to https://anbox-cloud.io/ or use the AWS image available [here](https://insert-link-here)

You will also need the Javascript SDK which you can get by running the following command:

`$ git clone https://github.com/anbox-cloud/anbox-streaming-sdk.git`
